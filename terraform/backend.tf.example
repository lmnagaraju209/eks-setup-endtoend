# Remote State Backend Configuration

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT use this file directly. Copy it to backend.tf and update values.
#
# After your first terraform apply, the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table will be created.
# Then copy this file to backend.tf and update the bucket name and table name
# to match what was created. Then run: terraform init -migrate-state
#
# The bucket name and table name are printed in terraform outputs after first apply.
# Or you can get them with:
#   terraform output terraform_state_bucket_name
#   terraform output terraform_state_dynamodb_table

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # S3 bucket name (must match terraform output terraform_state_bucket_name)
    bucket = "your-project-name-terraform-state"

    # Path to state file within the bucket
    key = "eks-setup/terraform.tfstate"

    # AWS region where the bucket is located
    region = "us-east-2"

    # DynamoDB table name for state locking (must match terraform output terraform_state_dynamodb_table)
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"

    # Encrypt state at rest
    encrypt = true
