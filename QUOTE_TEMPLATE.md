## Cost Comparison

**Indian Development Team** (outsourced to India): ₹20L-₹35L, 6-8 weeks, time zone/communication overhead  
**This Proposal**: ₹37L-₹46L, 4-5 weeks, same time zone, direct communication

*The "cheaper" option often costs more when you factor in timeline, management overhead, and quality. But if budget is tight, we can discuss phasing or scope reduction.*
