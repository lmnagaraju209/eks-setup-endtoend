# How to Talk About Pricing

After 17 years, I've learned a few things about pricing conversations. Here's what works.

## When to Bring Up Money

**Good times**:
- After you understand what they need
- After you've shown you know what you're doing
- When they ask (obviously)
- During proposal phase, before you start work

**Bad times**:
- First conversation (too early)
- When they haven't shown real interest
- Cold email with just a price (no context)
- Before you've established any value

---

## How to Present It

### Lead with Value, Not the Number

Don't say: "This costs $50,000"  
Do say: "For $50,000, you get a production-ready setup that would take your team 6 months and cost $180k+ to build internally. Plus you avoid the mistakes I've already made."

### Use Ranges

Don't say: "$47,500"  
Do say: "$45,000 - $55,000 depending on your specific needs"

Why? Gives you flexibility. Shows you understand there are variables. Leaves room to negotiate without looking like you're making it up.

### Break It Down (Sometimes)

Some clients want to see where the money goes. Show them:
- Infrastructure: $7,500-$9,000
- Apps: $6,000-$8,000
- CI/CD: $4,500-$6,000
- etc.

Others just want the bottom line. Read the room.

### Compare to Alternatives

**Internal team**: 2-3 engineers × 6 months = $180k-$360k, plus learning curve, mistakes, delays  
**Your solution**: $45k-$55k in 4-5 weeks, done right the first time

**Other consultants**: $150-$250/hour, might take longer, might not have the experience  
**You**: $150-$200/hour, fixed price available, 17 years experience

### Separate Project Cost from AWS

Make it crystal clear:
- **Project fee**: $45k-$55k (one-time, paid to you)
- **AWS costs**: ~$874/month (ongoing, they pay AWS directly)

This prevents confusion. Shows transparency. Sets expectations.

## Handling Objections

### "That's too expensive"

**Don't**: Defend the price immediately  
**Do**: "I understand. What's your budget range? We can prioritize phases or adjust scope."

Or: "Compared to hiring 2-3 engineers for 6 months ($180k+), this is actually cost-effective. But let's talk about what's most critical for you."

### "Can you do it cheaper?"

**Don't**: Just lower the price  
**Do**: "I can reduce scope. What can we defer? Or we could start with just infrastructure ($7,500-$9,000) and add phases later."

Or: "Fixed price already includes risk on my end. Hourly might be lower, but less predictable. What's your preference?"

### "We have an internal team, why not do it ourselves?"

**Don't**: Badmouth their team  
**Do**: "That's valid. How long would it take them? Usually 3-6 months for teams new to this. I can accelerate it and transfer knowledge so they can maintain it."

Or: "What's the opportunity cost? What else could your team focus on if I handle this?"

### "What if we already have some pieces?"

**Don't**: Ignore what they have  
**Do**: "Great! Let's audit what exists. Existing infrastructure reduces Phase 1 cost. Containerized apps reduce Phase 2. I'll credit you for work already done."

## Communication Templates

### Initial Response

```
Thanks for the interest. Based on our discussion:

Fixed Price: $45,000 - $55,000 USD
Timeline: 4-5 weeks
Payment: 30/40/30 split

This includes [key deliverables]. AWS infrastructure (~$874/month) is separate - you pay AWS directly.

I've attached a detailed proposal. Want to schedule a call to discuss?
```

### Follow-up (After 2-3 days)

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on the EKS proposal I sent. Do you have questions?

I'm happy to:
- Adjust scope to fit budget
- Start with Phase 1 only ($7,500-$9,000)
- Discuss payment terms
- Schedule a call

Let me know what works.

[Your name]
```

### Follow-up (After 1 week, no response)

```
Hi [Name],

Checking in on the EKS proposal. I know pricing decisions take time.

A few options if budget is a concern:
1. Start with Phase 1 (infrastructure) - $7,500-$9,000
2. Spread timeline to spread costs
3. Discuss custom payment terms

Happy to talk through what would work for your situation.

[Your name]
```

## Red Flags

**Walk away if**:
- They want it "cheap" (won't value quality)
- No budget discussion (not serious)
- Want everything for free (unrealistic)
- Constant haggling (difficult client)
- No timeline urgency (not a priority)

**Green flags**:
- Ask about value, not just price
- Discuss timeline and requirements
- Want to understand what's included
- Professional communication
- Have budget range in mind

## Key Principles

1. **Be confident** - You know what you're worth
2. **Be flexible** - But don't devalue your work
3. **Be transparent** - Clear about what's included/excluded
4. **Be consultative** - Help them make the right decision
5. **Be patient** - These decisions take time

---

## Final Tips

- **Always provide written proposal** - Creates record, shows professionalism
- **Include payment terms** - Sets expectations upfront
- **Set expiration date** - Creates urgency (30 days is standard)
- **Offer alternatives** - Shows flexibility, helps close
- **Follow up appropriately** - Not too pushy, but persistent

**Remember**: If they're serious, they'll find the budget. If they're not, no price is low enough. Don't race to the bottom.

After 17 years, I've learned that the best clients are the ones who value expertise and want it done right. The ones who just want it cheap usually aren't worth the headache.
