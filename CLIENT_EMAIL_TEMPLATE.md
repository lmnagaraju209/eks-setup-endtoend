**Subject**: EKS Setup - Pricing

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the conversation about your EKS setup. Based on what we discussed, here's what you're looking at.

**Investment**: $45,000 - $55,000 USD (₹37.35L - ₹45.65L)  
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks  
**What you get**: Production-ready EKS cluster with full CI/CD, GitOps, monitoring, and security on your AWS account.

*Exchange rate: 1 USD = 83 INR (approximate, may vary)*

The range depends on a few things - how complex your apps are, if you need multi-region, compliance requirements. After I see what you're working with, I can give you a firm number.

**AWS costs are separate** - you'll pay AWS directly for infrastructure. Figure around $874/month (₹72,542/month) for dev + prod environments. I don't mark this up.

I've attached a detailed breakdown. The short version: fixed price gets you budget certainty, I take the risk if it takes longer. I've done enough of these to know what they actually take.

**Payment**: 30% to start ($13,500-$16,500 / ₹11.20L - ₹13.69L), 40% at midpoint ($18,000-$22,000 / ₹14.94L - ₹18.26L), 30% at completion ($13,500-$16,500 / ₹11.20L - ₹13.69L). I'm flexible on terms if you need to adjust.

I'd like to schedule a call to:
- Confirm scope and requirements
- Answer any questions
- Finalize timeline
- Get started

Are you free this week? I'm flexible with timing.

Let me know if you have questions or want to discuss anything.
